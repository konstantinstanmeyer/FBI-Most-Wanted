# final-project-phase-2

As a user, I can view our homepage, view example suspects, view our navigation menu at the top of the screen, and select which of three routee I'd like to go to. The first route contains a list of suspects, as well as several pieces of information on each one about the crime they committed, personal details, etc. The second route while give the user a form to report a criminal, adding it to our suspect list page, as well as allowing them to preview their report. The third and final route will likely(undecided) allow the user to play several web-games based around the suspects.
