It is alleged that in March 2001, Gardner burglarized a business in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and stole a rare 1938 Talbot Lago T150C-SS “Teardrop” Coupe motor vehicle, chassis #90108. The vehicle is one of only approximately 16 such vehicles ever made. Gardner allegedly shipped the vehicle to Switzerland in 2006, had it restored in France, and in 2015 sold it to a buyer in the United States for $7.6 million.   On May 29, 2019, Gardner was indicted on 4 counts of wire fraud and 1 count of transportation of stolen motor vehicle in foreign commerce in the United States District Court, Eastern District of Wisconsin, and a federal warrant was issued for his arrest. In June 2021, Gardner was arrested in Italy, placed on house arrest, and fled in November 2021. His whereabouts remain unknown. ",

      "caution": "On August 26, 2021, a grand jury sitting in the United States District of Kansas indicted three Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) officers for their alleged involvement in computer intrusion, wire fraud, and aggravated identity theft offenses. These officers were members of Center 16, an FSB component also known as Military Unit 71330, and were part of a team within Center 16 known by cybersecurity researchers as \"Dragonfly,\" Energetic Bear,\" and \"Crouching Yeti.\"As alleged in the indictment, the three FSB officers, Aleksandrovich Akulov, Mikhail Mikhailovich Gavrilov, and Marat Valeryevich Tyukov, knowingly and intentionally conspired with each other, and with persons known and unknown, to obtain and maintain unauthorized persistent access (“hacking”) to victim computer networks belonging to companies and other entities in the global energy sector, including their power generation facilities, thereby enabling the Russian government to disrupt and damage such systems, if it wished. The defendants and their coconspirators targeted hundreds of American and international energy sector companies. Also targeted were over 380 foreign companies based in 135 countries including Albania, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Croatia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Pakistan, Singapore, Slovakia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. These companies included global oil and gas firms, utility and electrical grid companies, nuclear power plants, renewable energy companies, consulting and engineering groups, and advanced technology firms.\r\n ",

      "details": "Early on the morning of Thursday, March 6, 2008, a bomb exploded in front of the United States Armed Forces Recruiting Station in New York City’s Times Square. The device, which was built using an ammunition can similar to those found on the battlefields in Iraq and Afghanistan, was filled halfway with black powder and detonated using a time fuse. Although no one was wounded, the device could have caused significant injury and casualties if people had been close to the blast.\r\nThe suspect rode a blue \"Ross\" bicycle west on 37th Street, took a right heading north on Sixth Avenue, and made a left heading west on 47th Street before turning left to head south on Seventh Avenue. The suspect got off the bike near the recruiting station at West 43rd Street and Seventh Avenue, placed the explosive device at the recruiting station, lit a fuse, returned to the bicycle, and fled the scene. The suspect rode the bike south on Broadway before making a left on 38th Street. The bike was later recovered in a dumpster near Madison Avenue and 38th Street.\r\nAlthough the suspect appears to be working alone, he or she may have had a lookout or surveillance team of as many as five individuals located in Times Square at the time the device was placed. The suspect was last seen wearing a gray sweatshirt and pants of an unknown color. The height, weight, age, sex, and race of the suspect are unknown.\r\nDetails of this bombing are similar to those of two other unsolved bombings that occurred in New York City, one at the British Consulate in May of 2005, and the other at the Mexican Consulate in October of 2007. All of the devices were delivered by an individual on a bicycle and were detonated between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. The incidents may be connected.",
